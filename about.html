<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, Nice to meet you too! 
  I studied electrical engineering in college, and after graduation, I worked in a few different jobs. <br /> 
  <p>First, I was a graduate trainee engineer in a two-wheeler product production company in Pune, but I didn't feel like I was growing, so I left. 
  Then I worked with the sales team at an e-learning platform in Bangalore, which was a really nice experience. After that, I tried working in a manufacturing pharma and scientific equipment company in Chennai, but again, I didn't feel like I could grow there.</p>
  
  Now, I'm learning about front-end development and DevOps and looking forward to an internship in those fields.
  
  I'm excited to build my career in tech because that's where my interests lie. üèåÔ∏è</p>
